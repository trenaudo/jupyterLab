Rename the functions to `get_unique_list_f, count_case_f, remove_punctuation_f, word_count_f`. Add the _f suffix to each function name to ensure that you're calling the functions from your file.\n",

    "import function_file\n",
    "\n",
    "function_file.function_name()\n",

    "3. Renaming functions during import: You can also rename functions during import using the as keyword. This is useful if you want to use a shorter or more descriptive name for the function in your code. For example:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "from function_file import function_name as f\n",
    "\n",
    "f.function_name(arguments)\n",
