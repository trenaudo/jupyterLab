Consider customers with a high policy claim amount to be those in the top 25% of the total claim amount, and clients with a low customer lifetime value to be those in the bottom 25% of the customer lifetime value. Create a pandas DataFrame object that contains information about customers with a policy claim amount greater than the 75th percentile and a customer lifetime value in the bottom 25th percentile.\n",

To do so, select both columns of the dataframe simultaneously and pass it to the .describe() method.
